# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains minimal files and structure. The main directory includes:
- `.gitignore`: Standard ignore rules
- `.venv/`: Python virtual environment (local dependencies)

## Getting Started
- **Python Environment**: Use the `.venv` directory for all Python dependencies. Activate the environment before running or installing anything.
- **No Source Code Yet**: There are no source files, tests, or documentation present. All new code should be placed in clearly named directories (e.g., `src/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks/`).

## Conventions
- **Virtual Environment**: Always use the local `.venv` for Python commands (e.g., `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe script.py` on Windows).
- **Ignore Files**: Respect `.gitignore` and `.venv/.gitignore` for all generated or environment-specific files.
- **Directory Structure**: Organize new code by function (e.g., `src/` for main code, `tests/` for tests).

## Workflows
- **Dependency Management**: Install packages using the active `.venv` (e.g., `./.venv/Scripts/pip.exe install <package>`).
- **No Build/Test Scripts Yet**: If adding build or test automation, document the commands in a new `README.md` at the project root.

## Extending This File
- Update this file as the project grows, especially when adding new workflows, conventions, or architectural decisions.
- Reference new key files and directories as they are created.
